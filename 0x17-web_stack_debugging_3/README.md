This is the readme file for the 0x17-web_stack_debugging_3 project and the goal of this project is to:

Develop the ability to identify, troubleshoot, and resolve issues within the various layers of a web application or system. Web applications typically consist of multiple components or a "stack" (e.g., servers, databases, backend, frontend), and debugging helps ensure that these components work together efficiently. Here's a breakdown of the key objectives:

1. Identify Problems Across the Stack
Understand how to trace issues across various components like the web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx), databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), and the application code itself.
Debug common errors, such as:
HTTP status errors (e.g., 500, 404)
Database connection issues
Misconfigured servers or services
2. Troubleshoot Complex Issues
Develop skills in using debugging tools like strace, gdb, lsof, curl, and log files to track down the root cause of issues.
Work with different tools across layers of the stack to identify and isolate the problem (network, server, database, application).
3. Understand Server and Application Configuration
Learn how to correctly configure web servers (e.g., Nginx, Apache), databases, and runtime environments to prevent and fix errors.
Handle configuration issues related to web applications, permissions, environment variables, and more.
4. Optimize Performance and Security
Recognize performance bottlenecks or resource usage issues (e.g., high CPU, memory usage).
Improve the security of the web stack by detecting vulnerabilities such as insecure configurations or potential security risks in code or server settings.
5. Automate Fixes and Monitoring
Learn to automate debugging and fixes with tools like Puppet, Ansible, or custom scripts (e.g., shell scripts).
Set up monitoring to track system performance and logs, which can help catch issues before they become critical.
6. Real-World Problem Solving
Gain hands-on experience by solving real-world web stack issues, such as resolving bugs that affect application behavior or downtime.
Be prepared to handle issues quickly and effectively in production environments, minimizing downtime or failures.
In short, mastering web stack debugging allows developers, sysadmins, and DevOps engineers to keep web applications running smoothly by identifying, diagnosing, and fixing issues that could affect the performance, functionality, or security of the system.
